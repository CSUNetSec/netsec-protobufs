[Description]

Repository that contains all the protocol buffer specifications for data interchange within and from/to the 
CSU netsec group.

common/ contains commonly used types like IPAddressWrapper PrefixWrapper and CaptureSpec
protocol/bgp contains protocol buffers to store parsed BGP messages
bgpmon/ contains the protobuf specification to interact with the BGPMon system

[Note]
For now it seems that leaving the separation of these files to packages in the output programming language is 
easier. Therefore they don't carry any package information. 
Below we show the usage from golang. they relevant .protos are compiled and are named under a new package
"pb", the generated files are copied flat in that directory and then this is imported from our code. 

[Usage]

clone this repo from your project and run protoc like this from your Makefile (for golang output):

netsec-protobufs:
        git clone https://github.com/CSUNetSec/netsec-protobufs;

build-proto: netsec-protobufs
       	mkdir pb;
        protoc --proto_path=netsec-protobufs/ --go_out=import_path=pb:netsec-protobufs/ netsec-protobufs/protocol/bgp/bgp.proto netsec-protobufs/common/common.proto;
        find ./netsec-protobufs -name "*.go" -exec cp {} pb/ \;

then have your protocol buffer imports as:
	pb "github.com/author/proj/pb"
